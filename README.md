# Tile Based Rasterizing in Python
The basic rasterizing in python uses pygame and tile based maps. There are many clipping errors with this but it works well with turning a text file tile based map into a 3D environment. The game runs relatively fast and bullets are physical objects that have a velocity in the direction of when the player shot it.

## Controls
- Up, Down Arrows = Movement
- Left, Right Arrows = Rotation
- Space = Shoot
